        "markdown": "### DAuth Introduction, Setup and Usage\n\n\nDAuth is an experimental authentication mechanism that aims to pin an ethereum or other blockchain Smart Contract to an OBP \"User\".\n\nIn the future, it might be possible to be more specific and pin specific actors (wallets) that are acting within the smart contract, but so far, one smart contract acts on behalf of one User.\n\nThus, if a smart contract \"X\" calls the OBP API using the DAuth header, OBP will get or create a user called X and the call will proceed in the context of that User \"X\".\n\n\nDAuth is invoked by the REST client (caller) including a specific header (see step 3 below) in any OBP REST call.\n\nWhen OBP receives the DAuth token, it creates or gets a User with a username based on the smart_contract_address and the provider based on the network_name. The combination of username and provider is unique in OBP.\n\nIf you are calling OBP-API via an API3 Airnode, the Airnode will take care of constructing the required header.\n\nWhen OBP detects a DAuth header / token it first checks if the Consumer is allowed to make such a call. OBP will validate the Consumer ip address and signature etc.\n\nNote: The DAuth flow does *not* require an explicit POST like Direct Login to create the token.\n\nPermissions may be assigned to an OBP User at any time, via the UserAuthContext, Views, Entitlements to Roles or Consents.\n\nNote: *DAuth is NOT enabled on this instance!*\n\nNote: *The DAuth client is responsible for creating a token which will be trusted by OBP absolutely*!\n\n\nTo use DAuth:\n\n### 1) Configure OBP API to accept DAuth.\n\nSet up properties in your props file\n\n```\n# -- DAuth --------------------------------------\n# Define secret used to validate JWT token\n# jwt.public_key_rsa=path-to-the-pem-file\n# Enable/Disable DAuth communication at all\n# In case isn't defined default value is false\n# allow_dauth=false\n# Define comma separated list of allowed IP addresses\n# dauth.host=127.0.0.1\n# -------------------------------------- DAuth--\n```\nPlease keep in mind that property jwt.public_key_rsa is used to validate JWT token to check it is not changed or corrupted during transport.\n\n### 2) Create / have access to a JWT\n\nThe following videos are available:\n\t* [DAuth in local environment](https://vimeo.com/644315074)\n\nHEADER:ALGORITHM & TOKEN TYPE\n\n```\n{\n  \"alg\": \"RS256\",\n  \"typ\": \"JWT\"\n}\n```\nPAYLOAD:DATA\n\n```\n{\n  \"smart_contract_address\": \"0xe123425E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F051224\",\n  \"network_name\": \"AIRNODE.TESTNET.ETHEREUM\",\n  \"msg_sender\": \"0xe12340927f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90fhku767\",\n  \"consumer_key\": \"0x1234a4ec31e89cea54d1f125db7536e874ab4a96b4d4f6438668b6bb10a6adb\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2021-11-04T14:13:40Z\",\n  \"request_id\": \"0Xe876987694328763492876348928736497869273649\"\n}\n```\nVERIFY SIGNATURE\n```\nRSASHA256(\n  base64UrlEncode(header) + \".\" +\n  base64UrlEncode(payload),\n\n) your-RSA-key-pair\n```\n\nHere is an example token:\n\n```\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzbWFydF9jb250cmFjdF9hZGRyZXNzIjoiMHhlMTIzNDI1RTc3MzRDRTI4OEY4MzY3ZTFCYjE0M0U5MGJiM0YwNTEyMjQiLCJuZXR3b3JrX25hbWUiOiJFVEhFUkVVTSIsIm1zZ19zZW5kZXIiOiIweGUxMjM0MDkyN2YxNzI1RTc3MzRDRTI4OEY4MzY3ZTFCYjE0M0U5MGZoa3U3NjciLCJjb25zdW1lcl9rZXkiOiIweDEyMzRhNGVjMzFlODljZWE1NGQxZjEyNWRiNzUzNmU4NzRhYjRhOTZiNGQ0ZjY0Mzg2NjhiNmJiMTBhNmFkYiIsInRpbWVzdGFtcCI6IjIwMjEtMTEtMDRUMTQ6MTM6NDBaIiwicmVxdWVzdF9pZCI6IjBYZTg3Njk4NzY5NDMyODc2MzQ5Mjg3NjM0ODkyODczNjQ5Nzg2OTI3MzY0OSJ9.XSiQxjEVyCouf7zT8MubEKsbOBZuReGVhnt9uck6z6k\n```\n\n\n\n### 3) Try a REST call using the header\n\n\nUsing your favorite http client:\n\n  GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/obp/v3.0.0/users/current\n\nBody\n\n  Leave Empty!\n\n\nHeaders:\n\n       DAuth: your-jwt-from-step-above\n\nHere is it all together:\n\n  GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/obp/v3.0.0/users/current HTTP/1.1\n        Host: localhost:8080\n        User-Agent: curl/7.47.0\n        Accept: */*\n        DAuth: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzbWFydF9jb250cmFjdF9hZGRyZXNzIjoiMHhlMTIzNDI1RTc3MzRDRTI4OEY4MzY3ZTFCYjE0M0U5MGJiM0YwNTEyMjQiLCJuZXR3b3JrX25hbWUiOiJFVEhFUkVVTSIsIm1zZ19zZW5kZXIiOiIweGUxMjM0MDkyN2YxNzI1RTc3MzRDRTI4OEY4MzY3ZTFCYjE0M0U5MGZoa3U3NjciLCJjb25zdW1lcl9rZXkiOiIweDEyMzRhNGVjMzFlODljZWE1NGQxZjEyNWRiNzUzNmU4NzRhYjRhOTZiNGQ0ZjY0Mzg2NjhiNmJiMTBhNmFkYiIsInRpbWVzdGFtcCI6IjIwMjEtMTEtMDRUMTQ6MTM6NDBaIiwicmVxdWVzdF9pZCI6IjBYZTg3Njk4NzY5NDMyODc2MzQ5Mjg3NjM0ODkyODczNjQ5Nzg2OTI3MzY0OSJ9.XSiQxjEVyCouf7zT8MubEKsbOBZuReGVhnt9uck6z6k\n\nCURL example\n\n```\ncurl -v -H 'DAuth: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzbWFydF9jb250cmFjdF9hZGRyZXNzIjoiMHhlMTIzNDI1RTc3MzRDRTI4OEY4MzY3ZTFCYjE0M0U5MGJiM0YwNTEyMjQiLCJuZXR3b3JrX25hbWUiOiJFVEhFUkVVTSIsIm1zZ19zZW5kZXIiOiIweGUxMjM0MDkyN2YxNzI1RTc3MzRDRTI4OEY4MzY3ZTFCYjE0M0U5MGZoa3U3NjciLCJjb25zdW1lcl9rZXkiOiIweDEyMzRhNGVjMzFlODljZWE1NGQxZjEyNWRiNzUzNmU4NzRhYjRhOTZiNGQ0ZjY0Mzg2NjhiNmJiMTBhNmFkYiIsInRpbWVzdGFtcCI6IjIwMjEtMTEtMDRUMTQ6MTM6NDBaIiwicmVxdWVzdF9pZCI6IjBYZTg3Njk4NzY5NDMyODc2MzQ5Mjg3NjM0ODkyODczNjQ5Nzg2OTI3MzY0OSJ9.XSiQxjEVyCouf7zT8MubEKsbOBZuReGVhnt9uck6z6k' http://127.0.0.1:8080/obp/v3.0.0/users/current\n```\n\n\nYou should receive a response like:\n\n```\n{\n    \"user_id\": \"4c4d3175-1e5c-4cfd-9b08-dcdc209d8221\",\n    \"email\": \"\",\n    \"provider_id\": \"0xe123425E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F051224\",\n    \"provider\": \"ETHEREUM\",\n    \"username\": \"0xe123425E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F051224\",\n    \"entitlements\": {\n        \"list\": []\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Under the hood\n\nThe file, dauth.scala handles the DAuth,\n\nWe:\n\n```\n-> Check if Props allow_dauth is true\n  -> Check if DAuth header exists\n    -> Check if getRemoteIpAddress is OK\n      -> Look for \"token\"\n        -> parse the JWT token and getOrCreate the user\n          -> get the data of the user\n```\n\n### More information\n\n  Parameter names and values are case sensitive.\n  Each parameter MUST NOT appear more than once per request.",

Note, if you want to extend the core OBP banking model of Customers, Products, Accounts, Transactions and so on you can also add Custom Attributes to these standard objects.\n\nYou would use Dynamic Endpoints if you want to go beyond the standard OBP or other open banking standard APIs.\n\nDynamic Entities have their own REST APIs so you can easily Create, Read, Update and Delete records. However, you can also connect Dynamic Endpoints with your own API definitions (via Swagger) and so create custom GET endpoints connecting to any combination of Dynamic Entities.\n\nDynamic Endpoints can retrieve the data of Dynamic Entities so you can effectively create bespoke endpoint / data combinations - at least for GET endpoints - using Dynamic Endpoints, Entities and Endpoint Mapping.\n\nIn order to use Dynamic Entities you will need to have the appropriate Entitlements to Create, Read, Update or Delete records in the Dynamic Entity.\n\nYou define your Dynamic Entities in JSON.\n\nFields are typed, have an example value and a (markdown) description. They can also be constrained in size.\n\nYou can also create field \"references\" to other fields in other Entities. These are like foreign keys to other Dynamic or Static (built in) entities.\nIn other words, if you create an Entity called X which has a field called A, you can force the values of X.A to match the values of Y.B where Y is another Dynamic Entity or Z.B where Z is a Static (OBP) Entity.\nIf you want to add data to an existing Entity, you can create a Dynamic Entity which has a reference field to the existing entity.\n\nDynamic Entities can be created at the System level (bank_id is null) - or Bank / Space level (bank_id is not null). You might want to create Bank level Dynamic Entities in order to grant automated roles based on user email domain.\n\nWhen creating a Dynamic Entity, OBP automatically:\n\n* Creates a data structure in the OBP database in which to store the records of the new Entity.\n* Creates a primary key for the Entity which can be used to update and delete the Entity.\n* Creates Create, Read, Update and Delete endpoints to operate on the Entity so you can insert, get, modify and delete records. These CRUD operations are all available over the generated REST endpoints.\n* Creates Roles to guard the above endpoints.\n\nFollowing the creation of a Dynamic Entity you will need to grant yourself or others the appropriate roles before you can insert or get records.\n\nThe generated Roles required for CRUD operations on a Dynamic Entity are like any other OBP Role i.e. they can be requested, granted, revoked and auto-granted using the API Explorer / API Manager or via REST API. To see the Roles required for a Dynamic Entities endpoints, see the API Explorer for each endpoint concerned.\n\nEach Dynamic Entity gets a dynamicEntityId which uniquely identifies it and also the userId which identifies the user who created the Entity. The dynamicEntityId is used to update the definition of the Entity.\n\nTo visualise any data contained in Dynamic Entities you could use external BI tools and use the GET endpoints and authenticate using OAuth or Direct Login.\n\nThe following videos are available:\n\n\t* [Introduction to Dynamic Entities](https://vimeo.com/426524451)\n\t* [Features of Dynamic Entities](https://vimeo.com/446465797)",

To see the Roles required for a Dynamic Entities endpoints, see the API Explorer for each endpoint concerned.</p>\n<p>Each Dynamic Entity gets a dynamicEntityId which uniquely identifies it and also the userId which identifies the user who created the Entity. The dynamicEntityId is used to update the definition of the Entity.</p>\n<p>To visualise any data contained in Dynamic Entities you could use external BI tools and use the GET endpoints and authenticate using OAuth or Direct Login.</p>\n<p>The following videos are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/426524451\">Introduction to Dynamic Entities</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/446465797\">Features of Dynamic Entities</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"

However, an Endpoint is a specific URL defined by its path (eg. /obp/v4.0/root) and its http verb (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc).\nEndpoints are like arrows into a system. Like any good computer function, endpoints should expect much and offer little in return. They should fail early and be clear about any reason for failure. In other words each endpoint should have a tight and limited contract with any caller - and especially the outside world!\n\nIn OBP, all system endpoints are RESTful - and most Open Banking Standards are RESTful. However, it is possible to create non-RESTful APIs in OBP using the Create Endpoint endpoints.\n\nYou can immediately tell if an endpoint is not RESTful by seeing a verb in the URL. For example:\n\nPOST /customers is RESTful = GOOD\nPOST /create-customer is NOT RESTful (due to the word \"create\") = BAD\n\nRESTful APIs use resource names in URL paths. You can think of RESTful resources like database tables. You wouldn't name a database table \"create-customer\", so don't use that in a URL path.\n\nIf we consider interacting with a Customers table, we read the data using GET /Customers and write to the table using POST /Customers. This model keeps the names clear and predictable.\nNote that we are only talking about the front end interface here - anything could be happening in the backend - and that is one of the beauties of APIs. For instance GET /Customers could call 5 different databases and 3 XML services in the background. Similarly POST /Customers could insert into various different tables and backend services. The important thing is that the user of the API (The Consumer or Client in OAuth parlance) has a simple and consistent experience.\n\nIn OBP, all Endpoints are implemented by `Partial Functions`. A Partial Function is a function which only accepts (and responds) to calls with certain parameter values. In the case of API Endpoints the inputs to the Partial Functions are the URL path and http verb. Note that it would be possible to have different Partial Functions respond even to different query parameters, but for OBP static endpoints at least, we take the approach of URL path + http Verb is handled by one Partial Function.\nEach Partial Function is identified by an Operation ID which uniquely identifies the endpoint in the system.

        "markdown": "# Keycloak Onboarding Guide\n\n## Overview\nKeycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides production-grade OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 authentication services for the OBP-API. It serves as a centralized authentication provider that enables secure user authentication, authorization, and user management for banking applications.\n\n## What is Keycloak?\nKeycloak is a comprehensive identity provider that offers:\n- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** capabilities across multiple applications\n- **Identity Federation** with external identity providers (Google, Facebook, LDAP, etc.)\n- **User Management** with role-based access control\n- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)** support\n- **Standards Compliance** with OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML 2.0\n\n## Prerequisites for Onboarding\n\n### System Requirements\n- Docker or Java 11+ for running Keycloak\n- Network access to Keycloak instance (default: `localhost:7787`)\n- Administrative access to configure realms and clients\n\n### OBP-API Configuration\nBefore integrating with Keycloak, ensure your OBP-API instance has the following properties configured:\n\n# Enable OAuth2 login\n`allow_oauth2_login=true`\n\n# Keycloak-specific configuration\n`oauth2.oidc_provider=keycloak`\n`oauth2.keycloak.host=http://localhost:7787`\n`oauth2.keycloak.realm=master`\n`oauth2.keycloak.issuer=http://localhost:7787/realms/master`\n`oauth2.jwk_set.url=http://localhost:7787/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/certs`\n\n## Step-by-Step Onboarding Process\n\n### 1. Setting Up Keycloak Instance\n\n#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended for Development)\n\nThe OBP project provides a pre-configured Keycloak Docker image available at:\n**Docker Hub**: https://hub.docker.com/r/openbankproject/obp-keycloak/tags\n\n##### Inspect Available Tags\nFirst, check available image tags:\n`docker search openbankproject/obp-keycloak`\n\nCommon available tags:\n- `main-themed`: Latest themed version with OBP branding\n- `latest`: Standard latest version\n- `dev`: Development version\n- Version-specific tags (e.g., `21.1.2-themed`)\n\n##### Pull and Inspect the Image\n# Pull the OBP-themed Keycloak image\n`docker pull openbankproject/obp-keycloak:main-themed`\n\n# Inspect image details\n`docker inspect openbankproject/obp-keycloak:main-themed`\n\n# View image layers and size\n`docker images | grep openbankproject/obp-keycloak`\n\n# Check image history\n`docker history openbankproject/obp-keycloak:main-themed`\n\n##### Basic Container Setup\n# Run Keycloak container with basic configuration\n`docker run -p 7787:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \\`\n`  openbankproject/obp-keycloak:main-themed start-dev`\n\n##### Advanced Container Setup with Persistent Data\n# Create a volume for persistent data\n`docker volume create keycloak_data`\n\n# Run with persistent data and custom configuration\n`docker run -d --name obp-keycloak \\`\n`  -p 7787:8080 \\`\n`  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin \\`\n`  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \\`\n`  -e KC_DB=h2-file \\`\n`  -e KC_DB_URL_PATH=/opt/keycloak/data/keycloak \\`\n`  -v keycloak_data:/opt/keycloak/data \\`\n`  openbankproject/obp-keycloak:main-themed start-dev`\n\n##### Container Management Commands\n# Check container status\n`docker ps | grep obp-keycloak`\n\n# View container logs\n`docker logs obp-keycloak`\n\n# Follow logs in real-time\n`docker logs -f obp-keycloak`\n\n# Stop the container\n`docker stop obp-keycloak`\n\n# Start existing container\n`docker start obp-keycloak`\n\n# Remove container (data will be preserved in volume)\n`docker rm obp-keycloak`\n\n##### Troubleshooting Container Issues\n# Execute commands inside running container\n`docker exec -it obp-keycloak bash`\n\n# Check container resource usage\n`docker stats obp-keycloak`\n\n# Inspect container configuration\n`docker inspect obp-keycloak`\n\n##### Environment Variables and Configuration\nThe OBP Keycloak image supports these key environment variables:\n\n**Admin Configuration:**\n- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN`: Admin username (default: admin)\n- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin password\n- `KC_PROXY`: Proxy mode (edge, reencrypt, passthrough)\n\n**Database Configuration:**\n- `KC_DB`: Database type (h2-file, postgres, mysql, mariadb)\n- `KC_DB_URL`: Database connection URL\n- `KC_DB_USERNAME`: Database username\n- `KC_DB_PASSWORD`: Database password\n\n**Network Configuration:**\n- `KC_HOSTNAME`: External hostname for Keycloak\n- `KC_HTTP_PORT`: HTTP port (default: 8080)\n- `KC_HTTPS_PORT`: HTTPS port (default: 8443)\n\n**Example with External Database:**\n`docker run -d --name obp-keycloak \\`\n`  -p 7787:8080 \\`\n`  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin \\`\n`  -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=securepassword \\`\n`  -e KC_DB=postgres \\`\n`  -e KC_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/keycloak \\`\n`  -e KC_DB_USERNAME=keycloak \\`\n`  -e KC_DB_PASSWORD=keycloak_password \\`\n`  openbankproject/obp-keycloak:main-themed start-dev`\n\n#### Option B: Manual Installation\n1. Download Keycloak from [keycloak.org](https://www.keycloak.org/)\n2. Extract and navigate to the Keycloak directory\n3. Start Keycloak in development mode:\n   `./bin/kc.sh start-dev --http-port=7787`\n\n### 2. Initial Keycloak Configuration\n\n#### Access Keycloak Admin Console\n- Navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:7787/admin\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:7787/admin</a>\n- Login with admin credentials (admin/admin for Docker setup)\n\n#### Create or Configure Realm\n1. Select or create a realm (e.g., \"obp\" or use \"master\")\n2. Configure realm settings:\n   - **SSL required**: None (for development) or External requests (for production)\n   - **User registration**: Enable if needed\n   - **Login with email**: Enable for email-based authentication\n\n### 3. Configure OBP Client Application\n\n#### Create Client\n1. Navigate to **Clients** \u2192 **Create Client**\n2. Set **Client ID**: `obp-client` (or your preferred identifier)\n3. Set **Client Type**: `OpenID Connect`\n4. Enable **Client authentication**\n\n#### Configure Client Settings\n- **Root URL**: <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\" target=\"_blank\">your OBP-API URL</a>\n- **Valid redirect URIs**: <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/openid-connect/callback\" target=\"_blank\">callback URL</a>\n- **Web origins**: <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\" target=\"_blank\">OBP-API URL</a>\n- **Access Type**: `confidential`\n\n#### Retrieve Client Credentials\n1. Go to **Clients** \u2192 **obp-client** \u2192 **Credentials**\n2. Copy the **Client Secret** for OBP-API configuration\n\n### 4. Update OBP-API Configuration\n\nAdd the following to your OBP-API properties file:\n\n# OpenID Connect Client Configuration\n`openid_connect_1.button_text=Keycloak Login`\n`openid_connect_1.client_id=obp-client`\n`openid_connect_1.client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE`\n`openid_connect_1.callback_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/openid-connect/callback`\n`openid_connect_1.endpoint.discovery=http://localhost:7787/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n`openid_connect_1.endpoint.authorization=http://localhost:7787/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/auth`\n`openid_connect_1.endpoint.userinfo=http://localhost:7787/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo`\n`openid_connect_1.endpoint.token=http://localhost:7787/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token`\n`openid_connect_1.endpoint.jwks_uri=http://localhost:7787/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/certs`\n`openid_connect_1.access_type_offline=true`\n\n### 5. User Management Setup\n\n#### Create Test Users\n1. Navigate to **Users** \u2192 **Add User**\n2. Fill in user details:\n   - **Username**: `testuser`\n   - **Email**: `testuser@example.com`\n   - **First Name** and **Last Name**\n3. Set temporary password in **Credentials** tab\n4. Assign appropriate roles if using role-based access control\n\n#### Configure User Attributes (Optional)\nMap additional user attributes that OBP-API might need:\n- `email` (standard)\n- `name` (standard)\n- `preferred_username` (standard)\n- Custom attributes as required by your banking application\n\n### 6. Testing the Integration\n\n#### Verify Configuration\n1. Restart OBP-API after configuration changes\n2. Navigate to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\" target=\"_blank\">OBP-API login page</a>\n3. Look for \"Keycloak Login\" button (or your configured button text)\n\n#### Test Authentication Flow\n1. Click the Keycloak login button\n2. Should redirect to Keycloak login page\n3. Login with test user credentials\n4. Should redirect back to OBP-API with successful authentication\n5. Verify user session and JWT token validity\n\n## Production Considerations\n\n### Security Best Practices\n- **Use HTTPS** for all Keycloak and OBP-API communications\n- **Strong passwords** for admin accounts\n- **Regular updates** of Keycloak version\n- **Backup** realm configurations and user data\n- **Monitor** authentication logs for suspicious activity\n\n### Scalability\n- **Database**: Configure external database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of H2\n- **Clustering**: Set up Keycloak cluster for high availability\n- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancer for multiple Keycloak instances\n\n### Integration with Banking Systems\n- **LDAP/Active Directory**: Integrate with existing user directories\n- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enable MFA for enhanced security\n- **Compliance**: Ensure configuration meets banking regulatory requirements\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Authentication Failures\n- **Check redirect URIs**: Ensure they match exactly in both Keycloak and OBP-API\n- **Verify client credentials**: Confirm client ID and secret are correct\n- **Check realm configuration**: Ensure realm name matches in all configurations\n\n### JWT Token Issues\n- **Issuer mismatch**: Verify `oauth2.keycloak.issuer` matches JWT `iss` claim\n- **JWKS endpoint**: Confirm `oauth2.jwk_set.url` is accessible and returns valid keys\n- **Token expiration**: Check token validity periods in Keycloak settings\n\n### Network Connectivity\n- **Firewall rules**: Ensure ports 7787 (Keycloak) and 8080 (OBP-API) are accessible\n- **DNS resolution**: Verify hostnames resolve correctly\n- **SSL certificates**: For HTTPS setups, ensure valid certificates\n\n## Additional Resources\n- <a href=\"https://www.keycloak.org/documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Keycloak Official Documentation</a>\n- <a href=\"https://openid.net/connect/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenID Connect Specification</a>\n- [OBP OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow Manual](OAuth_2.0_Client_Credentials_Flow_Manual.md)\n- [OBP OIDC Configuration Guide](../../../OBP_OIDC_Configuration_Guide.md)\n\n## Support\nFor issues related to Keycloak integration with OBP-API:\n1. Check the OBP-API logs for detailed error messages\n2. Verify Keycloak server logs for authentication issues\n3. Consult the OBP community forums or GitHub issues\n4. Review the comprehensive troubleshooting section in the OBP documentation",

Create a Dynamic Entity definition (System or Bank Level) with hasPersonalEntity = true\n2. OBP automatically generates both regular CRUD endpoints AND 'my' endpoints\n3. The 'my' endpoints only return data created by the authenticated user\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n**Step 1:** Create a Dynamic Entity definition\n\n```json\nPOST /management/system-dynamic-entities\n{\n  \"hasPersonalEntity\": true,\n  \"CustomerPreferences\": {\n    \"description\": \"User preferences\",\n    \"required\": [\"theme\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"theme\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"language\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Use the auto-generated 'my' endpoints:\n\n* POST /my/CustomerPreferences - Create my preference\n* GET /my/CustomerPreferences - Get all my preferences\n* GET /my/CustomerPreferences/ID - Get one of my preferences\n* PUT /my/CustomerPreferences/ID - Update my preference\n* DELETE /my/CustomerPreferences/ID - Delete my preference\n\n**For bank-level entities:**\n\n* POST /banks/BANK_ID/my/CustomerPreferences\n* GET /banks/BANK_ID/my/CustomerPreferences\n* GET /banks/BANK_ID/my/CustomerPreferences/ID\n* PUT /banks/BANK_ID/my/CustomerPreferences/ID\n* DELETE /banks/BANK_ID/my/CustomerPreferences/ID\n\n**Key differences:**\n\n* **Regular endpoints** (e.g., /CustomerPreferences): Access ALL entities (requires roles)\n* **My endpoints** (e.g., /my/CustomerPreferences): Access only your own entities (user-scoped)\n\n**Note:** If hasPersonalEntity is set to false, no 'my' endpoints are generated.\n\n**Management endpoints for Dynamic Entity definitions:**\n\n* GET /my/dynamic-entities - Get all Dynamic Entity definitions I created\n* PUT /my/dynamic-entities/DYNAMIC_ENTITY_ID - Update a definition I created\n\n**Required roles:**\n\n* CanCreateSystemLevelDynamicEntity - To create system level dynamic entities\n* CanCreateBankLevelDynamicEntity - To create bank level dynamic entities\n\nFor general information about Dynamic Entities, see [here](/glossary#Dynamic-Entities)",

        "markdown": "The following steps will explain how to connect an instance of the Open Bank Project OAuth Server 1.0a. This authentication mechanism is necessary so a third party application can consume the Open Bank project API securely.\n\nThe following documentation is based on the OAuth 1.0a specification so if you need more details you can refer to it.\n\nBefore starting to interact with the API, third party applications needs to get OAuth keys (consumer key and secret key). You can register your application here to get those keys for interacting with real data. If you want to use the sandbox before handling real data, please register your application here\n\n### 1) Obtain a request token\n\nTo start a sign in flow, the application must obtain a request token by sending a signed message to :\n\n    POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/initiate\n\n* oauth_callback: an absolute URI back to which the server will redirect the resource owner (user) when Authorization step is completed. If the application is unable to receive callbacks the parameter value MUST be set to \u201coob\u201d (case sensitive), to indicate an out-of-band configuration.\n\n* oauth_consumer_key : The identifier portion of the client credentials (consumer key) which is obtained after application registration.\n\n* oauth_nonce : A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated by the client to allow the server to verify that a request has never been made before. The nonce value MUST be unique across all requests with the same timestamp, application credentials, and token combinations.\n\n* oauth_signature : the result of signing the request. Explained in detail here.\n\n* oauth_signature_method : The name of the signature method that will be used by the application to sign the request, as defined in OAuth protocol. The Open Bank Project OAuth server support \"SHA1\" and \"SHA256\" so the parameter MUST be set to \u201cHMAC-SHA1\" or \u201cHMAC-SHA256\u201d\n\n* oauth_timestamp : The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer and is expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.\n\n* oauth_version : OPTIONAL. If present, MUST be set to \"1.0\". Provides the version of the authentication process as defined in the OAuth 1.0 protocol specification.\n\nExample:\n\n    POST /oauth/initiate HTTP/1.1\n\n    Host: http://127.0.0.1:8080\n\n    Authorization: OAuth\n\n    oauth_callback=\"http%3A%2F%2Fprinter.example.com%2Fready\",\n\n    oauth_consumer_key=\"cChZNFj6T5R0TigYB9yd1w\",\n\n    oauth_nonce=\"ea9ec8429b68d6b77cd5600adbbb0456\",\n\n    oauth_signature=\"F1Li3tvehgcraF8DMJ7OyxO4w9Y%3D\",\n\n    oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n\n    oauth_timestamp=\"1318467427\",\n\n    oauth_version=\"1.0\"\n\nimportant: We will explain below in the \"signature\" section how to calculate the value of the \"oauth_signature\" field.\n\nNote : line breaks are for display purposes only, the application MUST send the parameters on one line and the only separator between the parameters is a coma \u201c,\u201d.\n\nThe server validates the request and replies with a set of temporary credentials in the body of the HTTP response.\n\nExample (line breaks are for display purposes only) :\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola&oauth_token_secret=hdhd0244k9j7ao03&oauth_callback_confirmed=true\n\nThe application should examine the HTTP status of the response. Any value other than 200 indicates a failure. The body of the response will contain the oauth_token, oauth_token_secret, and oauth_callback_confirmed parameters. The application should verify that oauth_callback_confirmed is true and store the other two values for the next steps.\n\n### 2) Redirect the user\n\nThe next step is to direct the user to Open Bank Project so that he may complete the authentication.\n\nDirect the user to :\n\n    GET oauth/authorize\n\nand the request token obtained in step 1 should be passed as the oauth_token parameter.\n\nThe most seamless way for a website to implement this would be to issue a HTTP 302 redirect as the response to the original request. Mobile and desktop applications should open a new browser window or direct to the URL via an embedded web view.\n\nExample :\n\n    http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=NPcudxy0yU5T3tBzho7iCotZ3cnetKwcTIRlX0iwRl0\n\nUpon a successful authentication, the callback URL would receive a request containing the oauth_token and oauth_verifier parameters. The application should verify that the token matches the request token received in step 1.\n\nIf the callback URL was not specified (oob) than the verifier will be shown in the page and the user has to enter it into the application manually.\n\n### 3) Convert the request token to an access token\n\nTo convert the request token into a usable access token, the application must make a:\n\n    POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/token\n\nrequest containing the oauth_verifier value obtained in step 2. The request token is also passed as oauth_token parameter of the header.\n\nNote : The oauth_callback_url parameter is not necessary any more.\n\nExample :\n\n    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1\n\n    Host: http://127.0.0.1:8080\n\n    Authorization: OAuth\n\n    oauth_verifier=\"9312832\",\n\n    oauth_token=\u201daze2342352aze\u201d,\n\n    oauth_consumer_key=\"cChZNFj6T5R0TigYB9yd1w\",\n\n    oauth_nonce=\"ea9ec8429b68d6b77cd5600adbbb0456\",\n\n    oauth_signature=\"F1Li3tvehgcraF8DMJ7OyxO4w9Y%3D\",\n\n    oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n\n    oauth_timestamp=\"1318467427\",\n\n    oauth_version=\"1.0\"\n\nLike the step 1, a successful response contains the oauth_token & oauth_token_secret and they should be stored and used for future authenticated requests to the OBP API.\n\nThe application can now use the access token to access protected resources.\n\n### 4) Access protected resources\n\nOnce the application has an a access token and secret token, it can access protected resources. The request is the same as in step 3 except the oauth_verifer which MUST not be included in the header.\n\nPlease see the API documentation for more details on how to access protected resources.\n\n### Recommended OAuth 1.0 libraries:\n\nIf you want to use a OAuth library to handle the OAuth process for your application, we have successfully tested these ones:\n\n* JAVA:\n\n [signpost](http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/). Warning any version below 1.2.1.2 probably will not work. Version 1.2 which is the current Maven version seems to cause problems.\n\n* PHP:\n\n [OAuth Consumer And Server Library] (https://code.google.com/p/oauth-php/)\n\n* Scala:\n\n [Dispatch] (http://dispatch.databinder.net/Dispatch.html)\n\n* OBP SDKs / examples of client code with OAuth:\n\n [OBP SDKs](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-Client-SDKS)\n\n### Examples :\n\nTo show the OAuth integration in concrete examples, please check out these projects listed here:\n[Hello-OBP-OAuth1.0a-LANGUAGE/PLATFORM](https://github.com/OpenBankProject)\n\n### Signature :\n\nAccording to the [section-3.4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4) in the OAuth 1.0 protocol specification the signature computation is done following theses steps :\n\n\na) Signature Base String :\n\nThe signature base string is a consistent, reproducible concatenation of several of the HTTP request elements into a single string. The string is used as an input to the signature methods.\n\nThe signature base string includes the following components of the HTTP request:\n\n* The HTTP request method (e.g., \"GET\", \"POST\", etc.).\n\n* The authority as declared by the HTTP \"Host\" request header field.\n\n* The path and query components of the request resource URI.\n\n* he protocol parameters excluding the \"oauth_signature\".\n\nThe signature base string does not cover the entire HTTP request. Most notably, it does not include the entity-body in most requests, nor does it include most HTTP entity-headers.\n\nThe signature base string is constructed by concatenating together, in order, the following HTTP request elements:\n\n1. The HTTP request method in uppercase. For example: \"HEAD\", \"GET\", \"POST\", etc. If the request uses a custom HTTP method, it MUST be encoded (Section 3.6).\n\n2. An \"&\" character (ASCII code 38).\n\n3. The base string URI from Section 3.4.1.2, after being encoded (Section 3.6).\n\n4. An \"&\" character (ASCII code 38).\n\n5. The request parameters as normalized in Section 3.4.1.3.2, after being encoded (Section 3.6).\n\nExplained shortly below the example.\n\nExample:\n\n    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1\n    Host: http://127.0.0.1:8080\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Authorization: OAuth\n    oauth_consumer_key=\"91919\",\n    oauth_token=\"OGESD9MrWQEGPXOyPjHCRrCw7BPelWJjnomibV6bePU\",\n    oauth_signature_method=\"HMAC-SHA256\",\n    oauth_timestamp=\"1340878170\",\n    oauth_nonce=\"DFXOQFZVK8K46KDR11\",\n    oauth_signature=\"bYT5CMsGcbgUdFHObYMEfcx6bsw%3D\"\n\nIs represented by the following signature base string (line breaks are for display purposes only):\n\n    POST&https%3A%2F%2Fhttp://127.0.0.1:8080&oauth_consumer_key%3D91919%26oauth_nonce%3DDFXOQFZVK8K46KDR11%26oauth_signature_method%3Dhmac-sha256%26oauth_timestamp%3D1340878170%26oauth_token%3DOGESD9MrWQEGPXOyPjHCRrCw7BPelWJjnomibV6bePU%26oauth_verifier%3DT0dXUDBZR09LUVlGTU9NSlhIUUc%26oauth_version%3D1\n\nThe request parameters normalization :\n\n1. The name and value of each parameter are encoded Section 3.6.\n\n2. The parameters are sorted by name, using ascending byte value ordering.\n\n3. The name of each parameter is concatenated to its corresponding value using an \"=\" character (ASCII code 61) as a separator, even if the value is empty.\n\n4. The sorted name/value pairs are concatenated together into a single string by using an \"&\" character (ASCII code 38) as separator.\n\nB) Signing the request :\n\nThe Open Bank Project OAuth 1.0 implementation uses the \u201cHMAC-SHA1\u201d and \u201cHMAC-SHA256\u201d as signing methods. The key to sign the base string is the concatenation of the consumer secret and the token secret with the \u201c&\u201d character in the middle like this: oauth_consumer_secret&oauth_token_secret, in the first step the application does not have yet a token so it will be an empty string.\n\nThe signature that results from the signature process MUST be encoded in base 64 also since the protocol requires encoding all the OAuth parameters.\n\n### Illustration of integration with a bank back-end :\n\nThe following link shows how the integration of the OAuth process would be with a bank back-end: [https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-Integration-Illustration](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API/wiki/OAuth-Integration-Illustration)",

For example: &quot;HEAD&quot;, &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;, etc. If the request uses a custom HTTP method, it MUST be encoded (Section 3.6).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An &quot;&amp;&quot; character (ASCII code 38).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The base string URI from Section 3.4.1.2, after being encoded (Section 3.6).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An &quot;&amp;&quot; character (ASCII code 38).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The request parameters as normalized in Section 3.4.1.3.2, after being encoded (Section 3.6).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Explained shortly below the example.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: http://127.0.0.1:8080\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAuthorization: OAuth\noauth_consumer_key=&quot;91919&quot;,\noauth_token=&quot;OGESD9MrWQEGPXOyPjHCRrCw7BPelWJjnomibV6bePU&quot;,\noauth_signature_method=&quot;HMAC-SHA256&quot;,\noauth_timestamp=&quot;1340878170&quot;,\noauth_nonce=&quot;DFXOQFZVK8K46KDR11&quot;,\noauth_signature=&quot;bYT5CMsGcbgUdFHObYMEfcx6bsw%3D&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is represented by the following signature base string (line breaks are for display purposes only):</p>\n<pre><code>POST&amp;https%3A%2F%2Fhttp://127.0.0.1:8080&amp;oauth_consumer_key%3D91919%26oauth_nonce%3DDFXOQFZVK8K46KDR11%26oauth_signature_method%3Dhmac-sha256%26oauth_timestamp%3D1340878170%26oauth_token%3DOGESD9MrWQEGPXOyPjHCRrCw7BPelWJjnomibV6bePU%26oauth_verifier%3DT0dXUDBZR09LUVlGTU9NSlhIUUc%26oauth_version%3D1\n</code></pre>\n<p>The request parameters normalization :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The name and value of each parameter are encoded Section 3.6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The parameters are sorted by name, using ascending byte value ordering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The name of each parameter is concatenated to its corresponding value using an &quot;=&quot; character (ASCII code 61) as a separator, even if the value is empty.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The sorted name/value pairs are concatenated together into a single string by using an &quot;&amp;&quot; character (ASCII code 38) as separator.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>B) Signing the request :</p>\n<p>The Open Bank Project OAuth 1.0 implementation uses the \u201cHMAC-SHA1\u201d and \u201cHMAC-SHA256\u201d as signing methods.

        "markdown": "Note: *OAuth2 is NOT allowed on this instance!*\n\nOAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, in this case any OBP REST call. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.\n\n### OAuth2 Roles\n\nThe following is a general introduction to a so called \"3 legged OAuth2\" flow:\n\n* Resource Owner\n* Client\n* Resource Server\n* Authorization Server\n\n### Resource Owner: User\n\nThe resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application's access to the user's account is limited to the \"scope\" of the authorization granted (e.g. openid).\n\n### Authorization Server: API\n\nThe authorization server verifies the identity of the user then issues access tokens to the application. E.g. Hydra\n\n### Resource Server: API\n\nThe resource server hosts the protected user resources. E.g. OBP-API\n\n### Client: Application\n\nThe client is the application that wants to access the user's resource. In order to do that, it must be authorized by the user, and the authorization must be validated by the Authorization Server: API.\n\n### Authorization Grant\n\nOAuth 2 defines four grant types, each of which is useful in different cases:\n\n* Authorization Code: used with server-side Applications\n\n* Implicit: used with Mobile Apps or Web Applications (applications that run on the user's device)\n\n* Resource Owner Password Credentials: used with trusted Applications, such as those owned by the service itself\n\n* Client Credentials: used with Applications API access\n\n### Step 1: Get your App key\n\n[Sign up](http://127.0.0.1:8080/user_mgt/sign_up) or [login](http://127.0.0.1:8080/user_mgt/login) as a developer\n\nRegister your App key [HERE](http://127.0.0.1:8080/consumer-registration)\n\nCopy and paste the CLIENT ID (AKA CONSUMER KEY), CLIENT SECRET (AKA CONSUMER SECRET) and REDIRECT_URL for the subsequent steps below.\n\n\n### Step 2: Initiate the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Flow\n\nOnce you have registered your App you should initiate the OAuth2 / OIDC flow using the following URL\n\nOBP-00010: Missing props value at this API instance - hydra_public_url/oauth2/auth\n\nWITH THE following parameters:\n\nOBP-00010: Missing props value at this API instance - hydra_public_url/oauth2/auth?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&response_type=code&state=GENERATED_BY_YOUR_APP&scope=openid+offline+ReadAccountsBasic+ReadAccountsDetail+ReadBalances+ReadTransactionsBasic+ReadTransactionsDebits+ReadTransactionsDetail&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FYOUR-APP.com%2Fmain.html\n\n### Step 3: Exchange the code for an access token\n\nThe token endpoint is:\n\nOBP-00010: Missing props value at this API instance - hydra_public_url/oauth2/token\n\n\nFor further information please see [here](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/concepts/login#initiating-the-oauth-20--openid-connect-flow)\n\nIn this sandbox, this will cause the following flow:\n\n1) The User is authenticated using OAuth2 / OpenID Connect against the banks authentication system\n2) The User grants consent to the App on the bank's Consent page.\n3) The User grants access to one or more accounts that they own on the bank's Account Selection page\n4) The User is redirected back to the App where they can now see the Accounts they have selected.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://static.openbankproject.com/images/OBP-OAuth2-flow.png\" width=\"885\"></img>\n\n\n\nAn example Consent Testing App (Hola) using this flow can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-Hola)",

        "markdown": "# OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow Manual\n\n## Overview\nOAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow is used when a client application (such as a backend service) needs to authenticate and request access to resources without user interaction. This flow is typically used for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication.\n\n## Prerequisites / Assumptions\nBefore making requests, ensure you have:\n- A valid **client_id** and **client_secret**.\n- This example assumes the authorization server (Keycloak) is running on **localhost:7070**. Replace this with the actual auth server URL.\n- A realm needs to been configured (e.g. 'master') and respective endpoint available: `/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token`.\n\n## 1. Requesting an Access Token\nTo obtain an access token, send a **POST** request to the token endpoint with the following details.\n\n### **Request**\n```\nPOST /realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:7070\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAuthorization: Basic Og==\nContent-Length: 104\n\nclient_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>&grant_type=client_credentials\n```\n\n### **Explanation of Parameters**\n Parameter         | Description |\n------------------|-------------|\n `client_id`      | The unique identifier for your client application. |\n `client_secret`  | The secret key assigned to your client. |\n `grant_type`     | Must be set to `client_credentials` to indicate this authentication flow. |\n\n### **Example cURL Command**\n```sh\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:7070/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n     -u \"open-bank-project:WWJ04UzMhWmLEqW2KIgBHwD4UNEotzXz\" \\\n     -d \"grant_type=client_credentials\"\n```\n\n## 2. Expected Response\nA successful request will return a JSON response containing the access token:\n```json\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\",\n    \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n    \"expires_in\": 3600\n}\n```\n\n### **Response Fields**\n Field           | Description |\n----------------|-------------|\n `access_token` | The token required to authenticate API requests. |\n `token_type`   | Usually `Bearer`, meaning it should be included in the Authorization header. |\n `expires_in`   | The token expiration time in seconds. |\n\n## 3. Using the Access Token\nOnce you obtain the access token, include it in the `Authorization` header of your subsequent API requests:\n\n### **Example API Request with Token**\n```sh\ncurl -X GET \"http://localhost:7070/protected/resource\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\"\n```",

        "markdown": "In the context of the Open Bank Project (OBP), a \"Regulated Entity\" refers to organizations that are recognized and authorized to provide financial services under regulatory frameworks. These entities are overseen by regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with financial regulations and standards.\n\n## Key Points About Regulated Entities in OBP:\n\n**Endpoint for Retrieval**: You can retrieve information about regulated entities using the <a href=\"/operationid/OBPv5.1.0-regulatedEntities\">Get Regulated Entities</a> endpoint. This does not require authentication and provides data on various regulated entities, including their services, entity details, and more.\n\n**Creating a Regulated Entity**: The API also allows for the creation of a regulated entity using the <a href=\"/operationid/OBPv5.1.0-createRegulatedEntity\">Create Regulated Entity</a> endpoint. User authentication is required for this operation.\n\n**Retrieving Specific Entity Details**: To get details of a specific regulated entity, you can use the <a href=\"/operationid/OBPv5.1.0-getRegulatedEntityById\">Get Regulated Entity by Id</a> endpoint, where you need to specify the entity ID. No authentication is needed.\n\n**Deleting a Regulated Entity**: If you need to remove a regulated entity, the <a href=\"/operationid/OBPv5.1.0-deleteRegulatedEntity\">Delete Regulated Entity</a> endpoint is available, but it requires authentication.\n\n## Entity Information:\n\nEach regulated entity has several attributes, including:\n\n* **Entity Code**: A unique identifier for the entity\n* **Website**: The entitys official website URL\n* **Country and Address Details**: Location information for the entity\n* **Certificate Public Key**: Public key used for digital certificates\n* **Entity Type and Name**: Classification and official name of the entity\n* **Services offered**: List of financial services provided by the entity\n\nRegulated entities play a crucial role in maintaining trust and compliance within the financial ecosystem managed through the OBP platform.\n\n## Configuration Properties:\n\nRegulated entities functionality is supported by several configuration properties in OBP:\n\n**Certificate and Signature Verification** (for Berlin Group/PSD2 TPP authentication):\n\n* `truststore.path.tpp_signature` - Path to the truststore containing TPP certificates\n* `truststore.password.tpp_signature` - Password for the TPP signature truststore\n* `truststore.alias.tpp_signature` - Alias for the TPP signature certificate\n\n**Fallback Certificate Configuration**:\n\n* `truststore.path` - General truststore path (fallback if TPP-specific not set)\n* `keystore.path` - Path to the keystore for certificate operations\n* `keystore.password` - Password for the keystore\n* `keystore.passphrase` - Passphrase for keystore private keys\n* `keystore.alias` - Alias for certificate entries in keystore\n\nThese properties are used for TPP (Third Party Provider) certificate validation in PSD2/Berlin Group implementations, where regulated entities authenticate using QWAC (Qualified Website Authentication Certificate) or other qualified certificates.\n\n## Internal Usage by OBP:\n\nOBP internally uses regulated entities for several authentication and authorization functions:\n\n**Certificate-Based Authentication**: When the property `requirePsd2Certificates=ONLINE` is set, OBP automatically validates incoming API requests against registered regulated entities using their certificate information.\n\n**Automatic Consumer Creation**: For Berlin Group/PSD2 compliance, OBP automatically creates API consumers for TPPs based on their regulated entity registration and certificate validation.\n\n**Service Provider Authorization**: OBP checks if regulated entities have the required service provider roles (PSP_AI, PSP_PI, PSP_IC, PSP_AS) before granting access to specific API endpoints.\n\n**Berlin Group/UK Open Banking Integration**: Many Berlin Group (v1.3) and UK Open Banking (v3.1.0) API endpoints automatically call `passesPsd2Aisp()` and related functions to validate regulated entity certificates.\n\nThis integration ensures that only properly registered and certificated Third Party Providers can access sensitive banking data and payment initiation services in compliance with PSD2 regulations.\n\n## Real-Time Entity / Certificate Retrieval:\n\nRegulated Entities can be retrieved in real time from the National Authority / National Bank through the following data flow patterns:\n\n**Direct National Authority Connection**:\n\n`OBP BG API instance -> getRegulatedEntities -> Connector -> National Authority`\n\n**Via OBP Regulated Entities API Instance**:\n\n`OBP BG API instance -> getRegulatedEntities -> Connector -> OBP Regulated Entities API instance -> Connector -> National Authority`\n\nThis real-time integration ensures that regulated entity information is always current and reflects the latest regulatory status and certifications from official national sources.\n\n\n**RabbitMQ Message Documentation** (other connectors are also available):\n\n* <a href=\"/message-docs/rabbitmq_vOct2024#obp.getRegulatedEntities\">obp.getRegulatedEntities</a> - Retrieve all regulated entities\n* <a href=\"/message-docs/rabbitmq_vOct2024#obp.getRegulatedEntityByEntityId\">obp.getRegulatedEntityByEntityId</a> - Retrieve a specific regulated entity by ID\n For instance, a National Authority might publish:\n{\n  \"comercialName\": \"BANK_X_TPP_AISP\",\n  \"idno\": \"1234567890123\",\n  \"licenseNumber\": \"123456_bank_x\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    \"PISP\"\n  ],\n  \"certificate\": {\n    \"snCert\": \"117\",\n    \"caCert\": \"Bank (test)\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nand the Bank's OBP Adapter converts this and returns it to the connector like so:\n\n{\n  \"inboundAdapterCallContext\": {\n    \"correlationId\": \"f347feb7-0c25-4a2f-8a40-d853917d0ccd\"\n  },\n  \"status\": {\n    \"errorCode\": \"\",\n    \"backendMessages\": []\n  },\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"entityName\": \"BANCA COM S.A.\",\n      \"entityCode\": \"198762948\",\n      \"attributes\": [\n        {\n          \"attributeType\": \"STRING\",\n          \"name\": \"CERTIFICATE_SERIAL_NUMBER\",\n          \"value\": \"1082\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"attributeType\": \"STRING\",\n          \"name\": \"CERTIFICATE_CA_NAME\",\n          \"value\": \"BANK CA (test)\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"services\": [\n        {\n          \"roles\": [\n            \"PSP_PI\",\n            \"PSP_AI\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"entityName\": \"Bank Y S.A.\",\n      \"entityCode\": \"1029876963\",\n      \"attributes\": [\n        {\n          \"attributeType\": \"STRING\",\n          \"name\": \"CERTIFICATE_SERIAL_NUMBER\",\n          \"value\": \"1135\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"attributeType\": \"STRING\",\n          \"name\": \"CERTIFICATE_CA_NAME\",\n          \"value\": \"BANK CA (test)\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"services\": [\n        {\n          \"roles\": [\n            \"PSP_PI\",\n            \"PSP_AI\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n Note the use of Regulated Entity Attribute Names to handle different data types from the national authority.\n\nNote: You can / should run a separate instance of OBP for surfacing the Regulated Entities endpoints.",
